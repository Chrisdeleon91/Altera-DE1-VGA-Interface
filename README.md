# Altera-DE1-VGA-Interface-using-VHDL
Programmed a VGA Interface onto an Altera DE1 FPGA in VHDL to output in synchronization with a custom programmed finite-state machine. A combined effort of all the knowledge learned from VLSI class consisting of a 4-but finite state machine (FSM) composed of 16 states (0 to 15) showing unique output display over VGA.
